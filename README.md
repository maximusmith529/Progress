# Progress
A checklist-based utility application meant to promote routines and progressive goals.

## Required features

### Checklists
- Made to help users organize and eliminate tasks from their routines.
- Can be modified by adding or deleting tasks.
- Push notifications can be sent depending on user preference.
- IE. A morning routine can be set to remind the user every morning at a specified time.

### Gallery 
- A gallery of photos taken by the user which is seperated into sections according to the checklists that they relate to.
- Used to record and commemorate progress with the user's goals and can send push notifications on signficant days.

### Reflection Section
- Optional activity decided by the user, the reflection section is meant to encourage growth and commitment to the user's routines.
- If the user doesn't complete a task in the amount of time that they set for themselves, (Ex. A monthly checklist is not completed within the month)
then they'd be asked what were the complications that arose, and potentially advised to lower the difficulty of the routine.
- Similarly, if they do finish their checklist in a timely manner they'll be questioned if the list was too easy and if so advised to make it more difficult.
- Hopefully, these 2 cycle to have a continous and healthy growth on certain goals like fitness and personal hobbies.
